# Face Recognition System
A face recognition system is a technology that identifies and verifies individuals based on their facial features. It involves capturing and analyzing facial patterns from images or video frames to match them against a database of known faces.

REQUIREMENTS :
                1) OPEN CV -> pip install opencv-python
                2) NUMPY   -> pip install numpy
                3) PYTTSX3 -> pip install pyttsx3

Using the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file, which is used to detect and recognise faces, we will train the model.
